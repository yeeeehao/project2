Team Members: Hao Ye, Juan Wang, Chuangjian Xia

Topic: Recipe selection and automatic recommendation

## Executive summary

The problem to solve: Many people want to learn to cook or like to cook, but often don't know what to cook or can't cook a certain dish.

The solution for problem: The webpage will provide a list of all kinds of recipes with specific production methods, and can provide random recipe recommendations.

## Goals

1. Realize user registration login and logout;

2. Make a list of recipes;

3. Categorized by recipe type (meat, vegetarian, soup, dessert, etc.);

4. Search for recipes;

5. Users can post their own recipes to the web page;

6. Users can modify and delete the recipes they post to the web page;

7. Automatically recommend random recipes (this is for choosing phobias).

This is our temporary goal, and some improvements may be made in the future.
