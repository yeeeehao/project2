## Overview

Our recipe site aims to provide users with an easy-to-use platform for finding and sharing recipes, and random recipes are not selected for people with phobias. The site will feature a clean and modern design, intuitive search and filter options, and a variety of user-generated recipes from a variety of categories, including meat dishes, vegetarian dishes, desserts, and more.

The problem to solve: Many people want to learn to cook or like to cook, but often don't know what to cook or can't cook a certain dish.

The solution for problem: The webpage will provide a list of all kinds of recipes with specific production methods, and can provide random recipe recommendations.

## Features

1. Realize user registration login and logout;

2. Make a list of recipes;

3. Categorized by recipe type (meat, vegetarian, soup, dessert, etc.);

4. Search for recipes;

5. Users can bookmark recipes and view them;

6. Users can post their own recipes to the web page;

7. Users can modify and delete the recipes they post to the web page;

This is our temporary goal, and some improvements may be made in the future.
